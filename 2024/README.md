# Advent of Code 2024

Solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 written in Java.

## Usage

```
./run build
./run <day> [example]
```

Where `<day>` is a number between 1 and 25. Passing any value to `[example]` makes the program look for a file named `example` at the project root to use as input.

The environment variable `AOC_SESSION` must be set to your Advent of Code session cookie for the fetching utility to work. Otherwise, you must create a directory `Matt-aoc` in your personal cache directory and manually save the input for the day you want in a file with the number of the day and no extension. Using day 17 as an example: `Matt-aoc/2024/inputs/17`. Refer to the [guide](../GUIDE.md#caching) for more details.
