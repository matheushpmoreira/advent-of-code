# Advent of Code

Solutions for the Advent of Code challenges. I solve each year with a different language for learning purposes! Since I'm not competitive and I'm just studying, I try to write readable and clean code, rather than performant code.

| Year | Language | Status |
| - | - | - |
| 2018 | Lua 5.4 | Unfinished (up to day 3) |
| 2021 | C99 | Unfinished (up to day 18) |
| 2023 | TypeScript 5.6 on Node 22.10 | Ongoing |
| 2024 | Java SE 21 | Ongoing |
