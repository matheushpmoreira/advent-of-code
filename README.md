## Compliance with automation guidelines

This project follows the [r/adventofcode](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode) community wiki [automation guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/faqs/automation):

- Inputs are cached locally after download.
- Network requests include a `User-Agent` header.
- Solutions are limited to one request per execution, and no automated or scheduled requests are performed.

### Caching

Inputs are cached in the platform-specific base cache directories:

- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%`.
- macOS: `~/Library/Caches`.
- Linux and other platforms: `$XDG_CACHE_HOME`, or `~/.cache` if not set.

The project cache follows the structure `matheushpmoreira/aoc/YEAR/DAY.txt`. Days smaller than ten are preceded by a zero for sorting. Examples:

```
C:\Users\Matt\AppData\Local\matheushpmoreira\aoc\2020\07.txt
/home/Matt/.cache/matheushpmoreira/aoc/2023/14.txt
```

### `User-Agent` header

All input fetching procedures include a `User-Agent` header composed from the template below. A username is obtained, in order of priority, via the `--user USER` CLI flag, through the environment variable `AOC_USER`, or from platform-specific utilities, if any. Otherwise, `unknown` is used.
